Progress Report on attempting to use the software from Detection of low-abundance bacterial strains in metagenomic datasets by eigengenome partitioning
(http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v33/n10/full/nbt.3329.html#supplementary-information)


https://github.com/brian-cleary/LatentStrainAnalysis

with the original paper data, and the cluster threshold of 0.8 (cosine similarity, roughly equivalent to sequence identity), we get 145 clusters for the metagenomic data
with cluster threshodld of 0.9 on the same data, we get 1264 clusters


for the first 100K paired end reads from the 10M random set, we get a single cluster with both 0.8, 0.9, and higher thresholds

instead, try 100K from the beginning of the sample, and 100K from the end for read1
